"""Tenant-isolation audit for Yacht OS.

Scans every server-side Supabase query chain and reports any that read or
mutate a company-scoped table without an explicit company_id predicate.

This is a static check. It cannot prove correctness, but it reliably catches
the class of bug that matters most here: a handler running under the service
role key (which bypasses RLS) that forgot its tenant filter.

Usage:  python3 scripts/audit-tenant-isolation.py [--json]
Exit:   0 = clean, 1 = findings
