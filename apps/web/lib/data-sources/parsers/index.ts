 * invisible. On a 54-page season calendar it means page one is imported and
 * the other fifty-three are discarded, silently, behind a green card
 * reporting a successful sync.
 *
 * A 35-yacht test fixture of 1,820 rows imported as one yacht and 32 windows.
 * The broker has no way to notice: the import succeeds, the card says
 * healthy, and the fleet is simply missing.
 *
 * Rather than rewrite six parsers to be sheet-aware, each sheet is handed to
 * the existing single-sheet chain on its own and the results are merged. A
 * page that cannot be read no longer costs the pages that can.
